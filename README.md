# OSCAR WINNING PREDICTIONS

## Proposal

And the Oscar goes toâ€¦

Will it be "Top Gun: Maverick", "Elvis", or the long-awaited sequel "Avatar: The Way of Water"? How do we know which will be the next Oscar winning film?  The goal of our final Bootcamp Project is to analyze past results to help us determine which factors most influence the decision-making process to predict the 2023 winners.

## List of Questions to be Analyzed 

- What features have more significant impact on predicting Oscar winners?
- Can we predict which movie will an Oscar award based on its genre, rating, director, and budget and how accurately can we make those predictions?
- Can we improve the prediction accuracy by considering the average ratings or box office returns of the movie?
- How much of an impact does a movie's length have on its chances of winning an Oscar award?
- How do the features of Oscar winning film differ from those of other highly rated films that did not win the Oscar?
- How do the features of Oscar winning film change over time? For example, do films that win Best Picture today have different features than films that won Best Picture in the 1980's?
- Are movies with higher production budgets more likely to win oscars?

## Communication Protocols
- Group will communicate through a group Slack channel and WhatsApp to ask questions and share project updates on a regular basis.
- Group will utilize class time to meet, discuss project goals, and plan meetings outside of class.
- Outside of class hours, we will plan to meet via Zoom and in-person (either on a Friday evening or Sunday afternoon) based on group availability on a week-by-week basis. We will use this time to discuss project updates, ask questions, present strategies, and assist each member so we are able to complete each segment of the project in an appropriate time.
